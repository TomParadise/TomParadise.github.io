Available to play soon, Rainforest Rampage Online - a digital reimagining of the board game with online features!

Rainforest Rampage Online is a recreation of the board game of the same name with a focus on online connectivity and features, so you can play together across the internet!

#### Description ####
---

Connect with up to 4 players and take on the rainforest!


Control your animal and take turns moving across the gameboard and drawing cards from the event deck. Aim to reach your target to earn points while avoiding poachers and deforestation drawn from the deck!

However, the deck doesn't only have dangers. Rangers, Campaigners and revoery cards will aid you throughout the game. 

Move strategically around the board and be the first to reach 200 points, or have the most point once the deck runs out to win.
