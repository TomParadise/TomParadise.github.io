This is my developer diary for the first game assignment in the Low Level Programming Module - Basic Reb0rn.

#### Entry #1 ####
---

We have been assigned with implementing the text based adventure game from a 
'write your own adventure programs' book in the BASIC programming language and 
porting it to modern C++.

At this stage I have already created the BASIC version of the game and have progressed 
quite far into the C++ port. I believe this assignment's goal is to refresh our programming
knowledge and get us back in the hang of things for the later assignments after Christmas.

Something I am working to improve overall, but also specifically with this assignment, is 
my focus on refactoring as I go. Because I find, after working for a while in one sitting, 
I have created a large section of code in one function and have to go through and refactor.
However, I think it is mostly due to the fact that the BASIC version is written in one block
of code so while porting it to C++, I am focusing less on refactoring. Going forward this is something
I will actively work on.

#### Post Mortem ####

I have now finished this assignment, given a viva to my lecturer, and received feedback for it. 
The biggest thing I have learned from this project is that I need to brush up on and further implement 
object-oriented programming (OOP) into my work. My lecturer showed how to access the module's OOP learning section 
and advised I look over some of the previously given tutorials on it. So, in preparation for the next assignments, 
and likely during them, I will be looking into the OOP learning materials so that my code can be more human readable,
reusable and efficient. For further work, I may adapt this assignment to have OOP features. For example, some classes 
I could implement into this assignment are a player class, inventory class, map class, room class, item class and enemy class.
