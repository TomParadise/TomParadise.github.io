Currently studying Games Technology at UWE Bristol. Previously took Computing, Mathematics, and Physics at A level.

So far over my first year on this University course I have created several playable games in c++, including pong, space invaders, and breakout, using the ASGE framework provided by the University. Also, I have created a 3D model of a tank in Maya 2018 and I am currently working on implementing this into a Unity gamespace.

To see more information on my c++ games have a look at my blog posts.
