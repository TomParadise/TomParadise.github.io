<img class="col one right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/profile_1.jpg">

I'm a post-graduate with a BSc and a passion to create games. I've created a fully released game available on Steam and many side-projects since graduating.

I most enjoy implementing interactive gameplay systems and mechanics with direct player feedback and response through an iterative design & implementation process.

When I'm not working on my computer I love to express my creativity through projects such as drawing or creating clay miniatures.
