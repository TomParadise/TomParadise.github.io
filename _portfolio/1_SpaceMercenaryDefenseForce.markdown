Space Mercenary Defense Force is a game project I solo created and launched on Steam Early Access. After the initial launch I continued developing it, releasing updates every week adding new content, major systems and features, bug fixes, & balancing as well as patch note writeups and social media posts. 

After over 30 total updates I released the 1.0 update and launched it out of Early Access. Post-launch, it has been played and covered by Youtube and Twitch influencers, and picked up by a publisher for 3rd-party console ports on all major console platforms.
